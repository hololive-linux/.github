# Hi there
This is the GitHub page for the (probably) first hololive-themed Linux distribution.

---

## Plans
My plan is to have an Arch-based distro with holoMyth themes. Some other future plans:
- Fubuntu, a Fubuki Shirakami themed Ubuntu-based distro
- Damn Good Linux, a Suisei Hoshimachi themed distro based on Damn Small Linux

and some more in my head. (Those are just ideas though - I might not make them anytime soon or even ever. Only the future will tell :D)
